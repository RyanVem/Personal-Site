					  	   <p class="sectionp1">Hi, I’m Ryan Vemulapalli, I'm fifteen, and I am a programmer in HTML & CSS, Python, and Arduino.
						    I basically started on my own learning from online videos and experimenting myself. I started off trying to learn 
							Mircosoft’s Visual Basics coding language, once I knew the basics of the language I decided to start making operating 
							systems with login screens, web browsers, games, calculators and more. It was fun, then I got to looking at more known
							 and useful languages with was C#. I took a few online courses to get me on the way to making apps. It  was at that point 
							 where I found the syntax was completely different and was much more difficult. I reached a point where I started designing 
							 a simple app where I could integrate it with my arduino projects through a bluetooth connection. It didn’t really work 
							 out too well so I took a little break.</p>

					  	   <h1 id="title">Computer Coding Academy</h1>
			 	  	  	   <p class="sectionp2">After my break from coding, I was looking around for courses in my area that was not online, but was in 
						   class in front of an instructor. I liked this better because I like a more hands on experience. A referral from a friend, 
						   I found Computer Coding Academy which was pretty close to me. There was a free session to see my level of coding experience. 
						   This was very nice to know that Nayera Kamel, the instructor,  would take time out for new people who may not even enroll 
						   in any of her courses. I myself took a ten day python crash course in the summer to see how I like it. Python is way more 
						   widely used that languages such as Java or C# so I thought it many be a good option for the future. I loved the course,
						   it was very detailed and she helped me complete the difficult tasks I was presented. Then I took a full HTML & CSS course 
						   with CCA and then continued it with a full python course. Both were amazing courses with high quality content in it.</p>
