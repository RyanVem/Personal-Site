						   		<h3 class="subtitle">Cinematography</h3>
						   		<p class="sectionp">A hobby that I like to do in my free time is cinematography, I like to do it because 
								it’s interesting and fun. I make little cinematic sequences and montages. I’ve shot a couple music videos
								 and a few short films as well. It’s something to do when I am bored or it’s just a good time for it. Sometimes 
								 I challenge myself to shoot a sequence in one room that’s about a minute long, this helps me improve and see things 
								 I never would've especially if I am shooting in multiple locations. I also edit my videos in Adobe’s software, 
								 Premiere Pro, which is one of the top editing software out today.</p>

						   		<h3 class="subtitle2">Automotive Work</h3>
						   		<p class="sectionp2">Another one of my hobbies is doing automotive work, this is something I like to do because
								 it’s more hands on. I can design different vehicles such as go-karts and mini-bikes and put it in real life. 
								 I also help with the cars in my family, for instance, oil changes, brake jobs, tire swaps, etc. I am also enrolled 
								 in my school automotive class where we work on many customer cars and where I am going to be building a race car. 
								 This will always be a fun hobby for me because I find it very interesting and relevant in today’s world, but the 
								 future is another question.</p>

						   		<h3 class="subtitle3">Riding E-Bike</h3>
						   		<p class="sectionp3">Vehicles such as my e-bike are fun to ride on a daily basis, if it’s by myself or with my dad. 
								I also take my dog to parks nearby for his daily walk. It’s a good way to transport especially if you do not have a 
								driver's license because as long you are 16 and above you can ride this on public roads. As it’s fully electric, 
								it is considered a green vehicle which helps the earth as well.</p>
